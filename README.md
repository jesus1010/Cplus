C++ tests

In this code I'm testing a multiplatform (raspberry pi, msys2, cygwin, Visual studio) logger with the next features:

-.Multithreading.
-.Flush line to line.
-.Console and file logging.
-.Define log levels.
-.No library dependencies.
-.Tabular output format for easy read.

A layering code struct with a vertical data flow.
