C++ tests

In this code I'm testing a multiplatform (raspberry pi, msys2, cygwin, Visual studio) logger with the next features:

-.Multithreading.

-.Config for flush line by line.

-.Console and file logging.

-.Define log levels.

-.No library dependencies.

-.Tabular output format for easy read.

A layering code struct with a vertical data flow.
